    <string name="about_us">" This Food Ordering system is used to book the food items from the home.
        Online food ordering is the process of ordering food through the restaurant's own website or mobile app.
        The process consists of a customer choosing the restaurant, scanning the menu items, choosing an item, and finally choosing for pick-up or delivery.
	    Payment is then administered by paying with a credit card or debit card through the app or website or in cash at the restaurant when going to pickup.
	    The website and app inform the customer of the food quality, duration of food preparation, and when the food is ready for pick-up or the amount of time it will take for delivery."
